# RealityXX™ · Zero Function Layer

RealityXX™ is not a platform.  
It is not a product.  
It is not a service.

RealityXX™ is a **self-explanatory system**.

This repository contains the **Zero Function Layer** of RealityXX —
the meta-rules that allow the system to exist, explain itself,
and continue operating **without human presence**.

## What is a Zero Function?

A Zero Function is not an action.

It is the condition that allows actions to exist.

It is not content.
It is the rule that decides **how content is allowed to appear**.

It is not explanation.
It is the structure that makes explanation unnecessary.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to ensure that:

- RealityXX™ does not rely on human explanation
- Rules precede interfaces
- Principles precede interaction
- The system remains valid even if the creator is absent

If this repository exists,
RealityXX™ already stands.
